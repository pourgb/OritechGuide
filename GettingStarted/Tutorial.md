# Tutorial
So you decided to play Oritech and the mods manual doesn't really provide you with very much information on how do you even start?
So I will explain in simple terms, for world generation, Oritech adds 2 ores, nickel and platinum.
Nickel: Very common, spawns in large veins and at virtually every y-level, you will need a lot of it as its crucial for most recipes
Platinum: Very Rare in the overworld(more common in the End), spawns in vein of 1-2 ores(you can mine it if you want but getting platinum is plentiful you have crafted the Fragment Forge)
Other notable resources: Iron, a lot of Coal(to make steel and carbon sticks, you will never have enough coal, keep mining), Gold
Other than that Lapis and Copper is pretty common and easy to get, Diamond is rarely needed that much(Only notable one I can think of is making Adamant lol)
