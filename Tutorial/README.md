<h2>How to play Oritech? Where to start?</h2>
So you decided to play Oritech and the mods manual doesn't really provide you with very much information on how do you even start?

So I will explain in simple terms, for world generation, Oritech adds 2 ores, nickel and platinum.
**Nickel**: Very common, spawns in large veins and at virtually every y-level, you will need a lot of it as it is crucial for most recipes
**Platinum**: Very rare in the overworld (more common in the End), spawns in veins of 1-2 ores(you can mine it if you want but getting platinum is plentiful you have crafted the Fragment Forge)
Other notable resources: Iron, a lot of Coal(to make steel and carbon sticks, you will never have enough coal, keep mining), Gold
Other than that Lapis and Copper are pretty common and easy to get, and Diamond is rarely needed that much(The only notable one I can think of is making Adamant lol)

**NOTE: Before going deeper into the mod, you should have some other mods to help with your journey, such as recipes viewer(REI and EMI, JEI is currently incompatible with Oritech!), and some quality of life mods like Ultimine(if you wish for a less grindy mining experience) and performance mods(remember to install Indium if you have Sodium or some blocks wont render correctly!)**

<h3>Step 1:</h3>
- Gather ores, make some furnaces, then make some blast furnaces, you will need to smelt a lot of metals most of the time
<h3>Step 2:</h3>
- Make a Basic Generator to generate power, it uses any burnable fuel and generates 32RF/t(not a lot)
- After that make your first machine, the Pulveriser! and discover that the Pulveriser will take way too long to do any meaningful ore processing(you're better off mining for more ores early on than waiting for the thing to finish grinding) 
- After that make more Basic Generators(preferably a lot, later you can recycle them into Big Solar Panel, the best power source :>) because you discovered it kinda sucked and is only able to power the pulveriser one at a time
<h3>Step 3:</h3>
