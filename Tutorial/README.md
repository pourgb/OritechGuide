<h2>How to play Oritech? Where to start?</h2>
So you decided to play Oritech and the mods manual doesn't really provide you with very much information on how do you even start?

So I will explain in simple terms, for world generation, Oritech adds 2 ores, nickel and platinum.

**Nickel**: Very common, spawns in large veins and at virtually every y-level, you will need a lot of it as it is crucial for most recipes

**Platinum**: Very rare in the overworld (more common in the End), spawns in veins of 1-2 ores(you can mine it if you want but getting platinum is plentiful you have crafted the Fragment Forge)

Notable resources: Iron, a lot of Coal(to make steel and carbon sticks, you will never have enough coal, keep mining), Gold, Redstone
Other than that Lapis and Copper are pretty common and easy to get, and Diamond is rarely needed that much(The only notable one I can think of is making Adamant lol)

**NOTE: Before going deeper into the mod, you should have some other mods to help with your journey, such as recipes viewer(REI and EMI, JEI is currently incompatible with Oritech!), and some quality of life mods like Ultimine(if you wish for a less grindy mining experience) and performance mods(remember to install Indium if you have Sodium or some blocks wont render correctly!)**

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

- Gather ores, make some furnaces, then make some blast furnaces, you will need to smelt a lot of metals most of the time

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

- Make a Basic Generator to generate power, it uses any burnable fuel and generates 32RF/t(not a lot)

- After that make your first machine, the Pulveriser! and discover that the Pulveriser will take way too long to do any meaningful ore processing(you're better off mining for more ores early on than waiting for the thing to finish grinding) 

- After that make more Basic Generators(preferably a lot, later you can recycle them into Big Solar Panel, the best power source :>) because you discovered it kinda sucked and is only able to power the pulveriser one at a time
<h3>Step 3:</h3>

- Make your first multiblock machines! A lot of Oritech machines are multiblocks, so you should be getting familiar with them, right click on the block to show a hologram of <strong>machine cores</strong> for you to place, fill the holograms with machine cores and right-click on the main block for it to transform!

- So now you might ask what are <strong>machine cores</strong>? They're important for adding addons, which modify how your machine works, a Big Solar Panel generates more power with better cores, a better core allows you to use more extenders linked together serially, which allows you to add even more addon to the machine, this can be crucial as some machine hog a LOT of power, and some recipes require some specific addons

- Back to the machines, you either start out with a Foundry or an Assembler, both are important for creating materials and resources much cheaper and allow access to more recipes outside of the crafting table

- After that make the Centrifuge and the Machine Fluid addon and start farming for wheats because you'll need it to make plastic, another very important material used in later machines

<h3>Step 4:</h3>

- Most tedious step is this, the process of getting fluxite, used in more advanced machines, to get fluxite you need to have an Enderic Laser. Now go on a journey to find a amethyst geode with your Enderic Laser, some basic generators, and an item fcalled Target Designator, without this your Enderic Laser wont work. When you have found a geode, place the Enderic Laser down, power it, hold the Target Designator and right click on the amethyst budding block, with its side open to the air for it to grow amethyst, and shift-right click the machine for it to start accelerating the growing process, once the amethyst have fully grown, right click on it and shift-right click on the machine for it to harvest the amethyst into fluxite, after that it will automatically return to the budding block, get a lot of fluxite before returning to your base!

<h3>Step 5:</h3>

- Now you need a better power source to run the next needed machine, the Fragment Forge, craft the Big Solar Panel, more is better, never will be enough >:)

- Optional: craft a large energy storage, a bit expensive now but worth it 

- Craft the Fragment Forge and start grinding nickel into clumps and realise that platinum is very easy to get this way! Dont be like me and mine 4000+ blocks to get 11 platinum :<, consider getting a yield addon, which doubles your output = more platinum

- At this point you should craft efficiency addons because all the machine chugs a lot of power :)

<h4>From this point everything should be clear enough for you to progress, the discord server is always open for questions so don't be shy :) </h4>
